Lab: Finalizing Your Learning Portfolio

1) What is this purpose of this Git repository?
	-This github repository is so I have a private (no cheating) way to upload assignments that can be accessed remotely for grading or to be worked on a computer that isn't necessarily my laptop. This repository also acts as a back up in case something goes horribly wrong on my local computer, I would have a fairly recent and well noted version that I could pull and use.

2) What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
	-I think that my favorite assignment was the mbta assignment. It gave me it fair share of grief but it's a project I would like to go back to and work on and refine more and I think that's why it's my favorite assignment. 

3) How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
	-Coming into class Day 1 with only Comp11 under my belt was a bit of a culture shock. I barely understood one programming language and did not expect to be able to pick up so many different languages and pieces of the web programming puzzle as we did in this course. 

4) What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
	-I think one of the most important things I learned in this course is how to be smarter about how the internet can be used to help with problems or to satisfy and expand curiosity. Take the group project for example, spotify api nonsense aside, I was able to take a solid assesment of what my limitations were in my knowledge of coding and web design. And so I'm now looking for little ways to take what we have working and improve it/make it shinier, ie make the alert box a nicer text overlay or other things along those lines. A second example that shows I still have alot to learn is my Assignment 4. It was uncharted territory for me mostly, and while I was able to find and use a few resources I am sure there were more efficient and helpful searches I could have done. 

5) Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
	-You may shake your head at this but I'd like to delve a bit deeper into front-end programming and design. I'm a human factors engineer and I'd been waffling a bit about if I wanted to work with physical product development or software development, but taking this class has cemented my enthusiasm for coding.
