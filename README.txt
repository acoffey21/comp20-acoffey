Lab: Finalizing Your Learning Portfolio

1) What is this purpose of this Git repository?
	-This github repository is so I have a private (no cheating) way to upload assignments that can be accessed remotely for grading or to be worked on a computer that isn't necessarily my laptop. This repository also acts as a back up in case something goes horribly wrong on my local computer, I would have a fairly recent and well noted version that I could pull and use. 
2) What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
3) How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
4) What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
5) Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
