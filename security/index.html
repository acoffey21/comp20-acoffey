	<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<div class="tab">
			<p> The product I was hired to asses is a server side web application that recieves data (ie. a username, score, and grid) from a 2048 game, stores that data in a mongodb database, and then displays certain aspects of the data to the client. My job is to asses this program and identify at least three potential security threats and weaknesses. </p>
		</div>

	<h1>Methodology</h1>
		<div class="tab">
			<p>My methodology involved whilst testing testing this application involved checking for some of the most popular vulnerabilities as listed on the OWASP Top 10 list and using Burp to scan for vulnerabilities and as proxy to alter information. /p>
		</div>

	<h1>Abstract of Findings</h1>

	<h1>Issues Found </h1>
		<div class="tab">
			<h2> Issue #1 </h2>
	
			<ul>
				<li> XSS </li> 
				<li> When getting the username from the pop-up box when the 2048 game finishes </li> 
				<li> High, no protection against malicious pop-ups or redirections </li>
				<li> I was able to input code in the username box to have a alert box pop up as well additionally redirect the top 10 scores to a youtube video of Rick Astley</li>
				<li> Alert Example</li>

				<img class="pic" src="XSS1proof.jpg" width="350" height="250" alt="result of making alert box"/></p>
				<li> Never Gonna Give You Up </li>
				<p> <img class="pic" src="XSS2acode.jpg" width="250" height="250" alt="coding of youtube reroute part a"/>
				<img class="pic" src="XSS2bcode.jpg" width="250" height="250" alt="coding of youtube reroute part b"/>
				<img class="pic" src="XSS2proof.jpg" width="250" height="250" alt="result of youtube reroute"/></p>
				<li>Some resolutions to this problem may be to limit the number of characters allowed in the username input to be less than two script tags or to code the removal of special characters from the input</li>
